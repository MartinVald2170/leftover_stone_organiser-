# Software Development Plan 

The application I am designing will solve the issue of disorganised left over stock from used slabs of stone within the work flow of a large scale stone company
# The Problem

In the current state picking out left over stock to be used for jobs is done manually and by memory. To relieve stress from the workers and to save time this app will allow you to caterogrize the stock. This will be done by labeling it with the type of stone it is, the colour of the stone and the specific batch number if you need the exact replica to replace another job.  

# Target Audience 

The target audience for this terminal app is for large scale stone companies where it is difficult to quickly pull up the information they need about leftover stock from memory. This will allow anyone to be able to access this catalog of information. For example the person organising jobs with possible clients can search up if the stone the client is interested in can be supplied from the leftover stock making it a more profitable sell rather than having to order more stock from overseas costing the company more money.
