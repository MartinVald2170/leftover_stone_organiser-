# Software Development Plan 

The application I am designing will solve the issue of disorganised left over stock from used slabs of stone within the work flow of a large scale stone company
# The Problem

In the current state picking out left over stock to be used for jobs is done manually and by memory. To relieve stress from the workers and to save time this app will allow you to caterogrize the stock. This will be done by labeling it with the type of stone it is, the colour of the stone and the specific batch number if you need the exact replica to replace another job.  

# Target Audience 

The target audience for this terminal app is for large scale stone companies where it is difficult to quickly pull up the information they need about leftover stock from memory. This will allow anyone to be able to access this catalog of information. For example the person organising jobs with possible clients can search up if the stone the client is interested in can be supplied from the leftover stock making it a more profitable sell rather than having to order more stock from overseas costing the company more money.

# Features of the app 
* Login/Password 
* Classification of left over stock 
* Adding Stone Stock with the values of the type of stone it is, the colour, the batch number and location
* Searching the catalog for batch number, colour, type of stone and location. Returning a true/false or information 
* Deleting stone from the stock when it is used for a job
* Log out   

*Login/Password*

This feature will allow access to limited people within the company so the stock database can't be used by someone without permission 

*Classification* 

Stone will be placed within a class and it is possible to add classifications of other things in the future such as tiles. 

*Adding Stone with Values (Type, Colour,Batch Number, location)*

This feature will allow the users to add leftover stock to the database with values of their type, colour and batch number for searchable ease. Stone can be added at anytime after logging in 

*Searching* 

You will be able to search the data base of added leftover stock for a certain colour, a certain type of stone and a certain batch number depending on what you need. 

*Delete from Database* 

When a leftover stock is used it can be deleted from the database easily 

*Log Out*  

A log out command will end the program
